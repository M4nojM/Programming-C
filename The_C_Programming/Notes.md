### Comments:
/* Any characters between these are ignored by c compiler */

### Variables:

* All variables must be declared before use

* A variable declartion announces the properties of variables such as data type name followed by variable name or
list of variable name.


### Data Types:
1) Primitive
2) Derived
3) User Defined

#### Primitive Data Types:
1) int
2) float
3) char
4) short
5) long
6) double

| Data Type     | Size (in bytes) | Range                                                  |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| int (16-bit)  | 2               | -32,768 to 32,767                                      |
| int (32-bit)  | 4               | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                        |
| float         | 4               | 3.4e-38 to 3.4e+38 (6 decimal places precision)         |
| double        | 8               | 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308 (15 decimal places precision)      |
| char          | 1               | -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 (depending on signed or unsigned) |
| short         | 2               | -32,768 to 32,767                                      |
| long          | 8               | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

#### Derived Data Types:
Derived data types are derived from primitive data types and include pointers, arrays, structures, and unions.

#### User-Defined Data Types:
User-defined data types are created by the user and include structures, classes, and enumerations. These data types allow the programmer to define their own data structures based on their specific requirements.
